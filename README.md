# tradelot-service
A lightweight REST API built with Node.js, Express and Sequelize for managing stock trades and lots. It lets you record buy/sell trades, automatically matches sells against existing lots using either FIFO or LIFO logic, and even bulk-loads batches of trades in a single transaction.
